      <p class="py-5 text-lg">
        A lot of people are always wondering if they should get their equipment financed. The answer to that question is yes, you should get your equipment financed. Equipment financing is a great way to get the equipment that you need for your business without having to pay for it all at once.
      </p>
      <p class="py-5 text-lg mb-10">
        There are many benefits to getting your equipment financed instead of paying for it all at once upfront. The most important benefit is that you don't have to come up with a large lump sum payment right away which means that you can save up money beforehand and then make payments on the loan as they come due while still having enough money left over to cover other expenses like marketing or payroll. This can be especially useful if your business isn't doing well because then you can finance the equipment over a term.
